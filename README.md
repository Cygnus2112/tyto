Tyto
====

A web app for creating, assigning and completing classwork and homework. Created by Parth Shah and Brian Provost.

Students
--------
Students have two views:
* A dashboard where they can view a list of their assignments and invitations to classes.
* An assignment view where they complete problems in a problem set. Problems increase in difficulty as the student's measured proficiency increases. The assignment is complete when the proficiency score reaches a certain level or when a certain number of questions are completed.

Teachers
--------
All of a teacher's functions are performed from their dashboard. They can create classes, add students to classes, and assign work to students. They can also view students' progress and proficiency on assignments and filter by struggling students.
